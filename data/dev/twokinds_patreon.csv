89700188,Notice: Stream Delay,"<p>Normally I have the color stream on the last Sunday of the month, which would be this Sunday, September 24th. However, due some things that happened this week, I will be postponing the color stream slightly to next week, on <strong>Sunday October 1st</strong>. I just need a bit of time.</p><p>This won't cause much of an issue, since next month would have had an extra week of sketches anyway. Instead, October will have the usual 3 weeks of sketches.</p><p>I will finish up sketches and prepare the color poll to go up sometime next week for you all. Hope you'll all look forward to seeing the winners.

88206535,Drawing Dragons,"<p>Some step-by-step processes to how I draw dragon dragons, suggested by Van Korben!<br><br>I realize this doesn't show the whole dragon, but maybe that'll be in a sequel. I wasn't sure how else to explain how I draw dragons, which the prompt requested, so this was all I could think to do! My style is pretty simplistic. Just note, for the muzzle I don't actually draw out that box in front, but I think it's a good way to visualize what I think in my head about the 3D space - a tapered box jutting out in front of the sphere, which then informs the muzzle. Breaking down characters into simple shapes is a common tactic for those getting used to drawing.<br><br>I'm not sure if this is helpful, but I hope it's at least interesting!</p>",drawingdragons.png,image_file,https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/88206535/3f58ab75f2d64709a31d7a56796ebb6a/eyJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/1.png?token-time=1697068800&token-hash=O4ENEceIs1VkwePdncI_KuV0DumNmuk5PoVpmCssy7w%3D,https://www.patreon.com/posts/drawing-dragons-88206535,2023-08-24T22:48:55.000+00:00

87913673,Flora Meets Old Flora,"<p>Flora meets her early comic counterpart and have a conversation about each others looks, suggested by Jeebuus! Old Flora isn't aware that her modern counterpart is pregnant, which I'm sure will be quite a shock.</p><p>I chose to go with the mid-2004 look for old Flora, from the chapter when she briefly wore her hair up, because I just really liked that look. It's a shame I didn't revisit it more, I think it's nice.</p><p>Flora's early design went through a lot of fluctuations in the beginning. There was no set standard at the time and I was very new to comicing, so Flora's chest fluff appeared and disappeared frequently, sometimes she would be more or less busty, her hair thingies changed size all the time, it was all over the place. I simply tried my best to evoke the feeling of her earlier look as best I could in this sketch.</p><p>Twokinds is still a constantly evolving process, and character designs continue to go through changes even to this day, though those changes have become more gradual in recent years. I think that's what makes webcomics special, seeing the constant evolution they go through. It's all one long living art experiment.</p><p>(I also included the version from the stream where the Floras are just speaking in nyas)</p><p>See also: <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/posts/flora-vs-54654646"">Flora vs ProtoFlora</a> (Flora's pre-twokinds design)</p>",floravsoldflora_nya.png,image_file,https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/87913673/9062eb6045d141758c9c286abe0652f8/eyJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/1.png?token-time=1697068800&token-hash=gcBSFqiYavT5KttgMnuMx3M2IxDtNg7vLe0c-nToEZQ%3D,https://www.patreon.com/posts/flora-meets-old-87913673,2023-08-19T01:38:36.000+00:00

So Willow could technically make herself look different if she wanted to and had the energy (black spots). In the lore, she doesn't use this ability and sticks with Maya's lioness body because she's afraid she might forget the details of what her friend looked like and be unable to return to it.</p>",wolfwillow.png,image_file,https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/87805444/d13bd8f39093444fbff7bbbfcce25bbd/eyJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/1.png?token-time=1697068800&token-hash=H_WK8-Nclahp7g093mwtAJcrUa0528FixwM6Rryv500%3D,https://www.patreon.com/posts/wolf-willow-87805444,2023-08-16T21:31:08.000+00:00

85023602,Templar Organization,"<p>A chart showing the basics of the Templar hierarchy, suggested by SpillTheFire6!</p><p><strong>History:</strong></p><p>The Templar started out as a tiny guild, funded by one well-connected individual (who I haven't had time to flesh out yet). They only really rose to prominence during the first war against the Keidran hundreds of years prior to the start of the comic. A war which the human race was losing ground due to the overwhelming Keidran numbers until the Templar helped turn the tide. This made them very popular among the human populace, who saw them as noble protectors rather than the zealots they'd eventually become.</p><p><strong>Basic Hierarchy:</strong></p><p>The Grand Templar sits at the top and controls the overall direction of the guild. The Master Templars act as his inner circle, basically a board of directors. They have areas they focus on, but there's a lot of overlap. They delegate tasks to the High Templars, who are the senior commanders of the various Templar Corps. From there it splinters off into more specific roles and ranks, depending on the corps, going from Mages and Knights all the way down to Initiates.</p><p>The Templar have a lot of ""off the books"" R&amp;D and secret employees who aren't technically part of the organization, and there's a lot of infighting among the ranks regarding which department should control what and who should be at the top.</p><p>Ever since Trace's coup and eventual disappearance, many Templar feel like the guild has become a ship without a rudder, with leaders preoccupied with their own agendas rather than the betterment of the guild as a whole.</p><p>----</p><p>This took a lot of time and research, since the inner workings of the Templar is not something I had fully fleshed out in my personal notes. Keep in mind, I am not actually the manager of an evil organization in real life, so if there's any gaps or issues regarding how a large company would really be run, I apologize! Feel free to share your own input if you have some expertise, I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p>",templarchart.png,image_file,https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/85023602/98e214e655b64b228cde37ec05ef3549/eyJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/1.png?token-time=1697068800&token-hash=mzQej17PdfeU4l0sm7yaF0G0oVKKDjZFsX9o9P178LA%3D,https://www.patreon.com/posts/templar-85023602,2023-06-23T20:45:24.000+00:00

78958740,Laura's First Console,"<p>Modern AU - A young Laura discovers her first love, suggested by GiantBurger!</p><p>Not sure why I chose an SNES parody... I could have gone with something slightly more modern like an early Playstation or XBox, or tried to fabricated one entirely... but I think maybe just because it was <em>my</em> first console I felt like drawing something a little nostalgic for me. :) I was a 90's kid after all. I also think, on top of this sketch being set in the past, it might make sense to have the modern TK setting be slightly behind our own, technology wise, since the existence of magic might have meant less pressure to develop alternatives.</p><p>For those wondering about the prices, the Modern AU's currency (1G) is about 10 dollars. <em>(It's actually a little more, but 10 makes it easy to just move the decimal over to the right one place and get a rough idea of the equivalent value.)</em> I have a fondness for settings that uses smaller values for prices, so that the pennies are still useful.

This was just after Natani used the Heart's Desire on him, so he might think this is another Laura illusion, but after he gets she's real, there would definitely be hell to pay for Eric for buying his fiancée.</em></p><p><em>After that, I could see it going one of two ways. Laura might try to persuade Keith to continue on to the island and complete his journey anyway. In which case, things happen as usual, except Laura would be on the ship, and I suspect when Alabaster starts pushing for Keith to kill Natani (and Laura, maybe, in this timeline) Keith would likely just go, you know what, forget this, let's get out of here.</em></p><p><em>The other way would be Keith straight up saying he doesn't need the island once he's made up with Laura in Eric's estate.

58781866,Trace and Natani AU,"<p>An alternate universe where Natani met Trace when he first woke up instead of Flora, suggested by Brandon Awesome!</p><p>----</p><p>The only way I can figure this working is if Flora never ran from the<strong> </strong>arranged marriage with Sythe (or there never was an arranged marriage and Flora remained with the tigers) and at some point Natani and Zen were caught by slavers and taken into human territory. Trace would wake up and bumble across Natani cornered, fighting the slavers after having escaped them, and Trace would run in and help, not understanding the situation.</p><p>Natani would be immediately aggressive towards Trace, but then realize he's an idiot and think ""I could use this to get Zen back."" With the mental link, Trace and Natani start trying to track Zen's location down. As they travel, Natani picks up human speech out of necessity - which he'd already started doing since being captured by humans - and in turn, Natani starts training Trace to stop him from being such a wuss in physical combat.</p><p>They stumble upon Keith like normal, since he's in the nearby town. There would be a lot of aggression here, since this is early, Keidran-hating Keith. There'd be no run-in with Euchre since there's no Flora, although Euchre would still be keeping an eye on Trace from a distance, and Nora would certainly still show up at some point. There'd also be no assassin ambush in the woods, since... that was Natani and Zen, obviously. Although there could be some other wolf attack here instead that might be interesting, what with Natani defending a human. I could imagine some moment of truth where Natani has the chance to betray Trace and almost considers it, but ultimately chooses not to, and the wolves label Natani a traitor. Keith would see Natani in a new light and start reconsidering his thoughts on Keidran.</p><p>Eventually they'd make it to the coast and it would turn out Eric's family are the one's that are housing Zen, having facilitated the slave trade. They'd break him free at night and then decide to steal Eric's ship, since they're still going along with the idea of traveling to the Basitin Island for Keith's sake, and Natani &amp; Zen has nowhere else to go, being labeled traitors.</p><p>----</p><p>That's as far as I've thought about this. It is a shame that Flora gets written out of the story in this alternate universe, although perhaps if the arranged marriage never happened, Flora could still show up as a character when the party eventually travels into tiger territory. Which... still hasn't happened yet, but yeah, there's room for Flora to still show up.</p><p>There's even ways to have her show up earlier, if, say... there <em>was</em> an arranged marriage, but she only ran <em>after</em> arriving in wolf territory, so she'd run into the gang right before Eric's town. That might even be how the gang end up fighting wolves near the border, since they could be the ones trying to get Flora back.</p>",traceandnataniau.png,image_file,https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/58781866/ad20c68919d248b8a9e9f171236a9f92/eyJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/1.png?token-time=1697068800&token-hash=NARfDQILusRseg2-Of1VCmjrr0UDTv99ZvB8nLbynzg%3D,https://www.patreon.com/posts/trace-and-natani-58781866,2021-11-16T20:20:22.000+00:00

52311813,Proto-Flora,"<p>Flora's original design, suggested by Orekh!</p><p>Before Twokinds, there was a black and white cat named Kaylia. She went through several designs and iterations, until eventually Twokinds began. The name became Flora, but for the first couple pages, she was still just a house cat. However, by coincidence, Halloween happened to fall a few days after the comic began, and I decided to try coloring Flora as a tiger. It was one of the first times she was ever in color, and what started as just a Halloween costume instantly became Flora's actual design. I'd later go back and retroactively change her to a tiger in the first couple pages (which were black and white anyway).</p><p>In the comic before Twokinds, the main character was actually Raine! Raine and Kaylia were good friends / rivals in the series, which is funny, because in Twokinds, Raine and Flora have practically zero interaction with each other. Strange how things end up.</p>",protoflora.png,image_file,https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/52311813/94af5991c569407880a5095b36e6ea1e/eyJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/1.png?token-time=1697068800&token-hash=Y5o9AAq8WGkg5nnImg7VnhEzugQH3O8pgGzHeI9y1kY%3D,https://www.patreon.com/posts/proto-flora-52311813,2021-06-09T21:46:20.000+00:00

48321357,The Mother,"<p>#3 Color vote from February, suggested by Starcat13!</p><p><br></p><p>Deep in the forest, Laura meets Willow's ""Mother"" - the source of the fay.</p><p>Willow's mother was originally a beautiful young dragon, one of the very first born. As a child, she was a rambunctious risk-taker, having been told by her own mother that dragons were immortal, and thus she had nothing to fear. But one day, she became injured, and was told to be more careful. That even though dragons were biologically immortal and would never die of old age, she could be killed like any other creature.</p><p>The thought terrified the young dragoness. Not just the thought of death, but the idea that, unlike other creatures who had finite lives, when she died, she would be missing out on a potentially infinite life she could have otherwise lived, and that no matter how long she lived, it was inevitable. Death became a specter, lurking everywhere. She needed safety.</p><p>One day, she found an enormous field of black mana crystals deep in the forest. Black crystals commonly form around battlefields where many have died. She could feel their power and was sure this was the answer to her fears. She fed off of them, believing they would last her forever. And though the crystals shrunk only imperceptive, year after year, they did eventually begin to run out. By then her natural dragon magic had been entirely replaced by the substance made from souls, and she desperately needed more.</p><p>Fearing to go out herself, she used her shapeshifting in an unnatural way and split off pieces of herself to send into the world outside her forest. First to gather black mana from other battlefields and places of death. And then, when those sources became rarer, to find any people who have died recently and bring their life force back. When even that wasn't enough, in desperation, she sent her wisps to lead wandering travelers astray to their deaths. The more she split herself, the less like a dragon she became. Travelers would come to call the strange creatures the fay.</p><p>Willow was one such creature, a wisp, but became lost and eventually developed her own personality, and a fear of ever returning to her ""mother"" else she might consume her once more.</p><p>But you know, other than the murdering, she's pretty nice.</p>",themother_color.png,image_file,https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/48321357/c816fa54e0774f82915e4824d861764e/eyJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/1.png?token-time=1697068800&token-hash=EUfAHww6dS0VW1p9DfCMZmRv15Lj6ulAl5oLi0iBVUc%3D,https://www.patreon.com/posts/mother-48321357,2021-03-04T17:01:01.000+00:00

She's an actual Will-o'-the-Wisp, and unavoidably leads travelers to their doom, whether she wants to or not. Her body is that of a lost girl she once befriended and tried to guide safely out of the forest, but it inevitably lead to a tragic end. She grieves the fact that she couldn't save her, nor can she stop taking on her appearance. She's always careful to never let anyone follow her lead now. </em></blockquote>",willowwisp.png,image_file,https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/30315756/c52e3dde69db4da281248a5cd68147ae/eyJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/1.png?token-time=1697068800&token-hash=ocRYVkwpQZZzYrBN_bJqV5Ptss78t21sMqq-TLCz5c0%3D,https://www.patreon.com/posts/willow-wisp-30315756,2019-09-28T18:19:00.000+00:00

Magical Mishaps #1 is over! The next story is still in the works, so it might be a little while before we get into MM#2, especially with all the conventions coming up in July. I cannot say exactly when it will start, but I will be sure to let you know! For now, I want to give you guys an opportunity to discuss both this comic, and future upcoming comics, if you'd like, along with answering questions.</p><p>Magical Mishaps #2 will not be a sequel to MM#1. As I said before, This is an anthology of different encounters with various magical items, creatures, beasts, spells, etc. Not all Magical Mishaps stories will be full-sized like this one. I hope to do some shorter ones, in the 1 - 6 page range that cover simple, one-off mishaps.</p><p>Some stories may not involve Twokinds characters at all, but might feature new characters, monsters, and events in locations of the Twokinds world that would otherwise not be covered in the mainline series. Hopefully, you guys will still find them entertaining without most of the familiar faces!</p><p>Please, feel free to discuss what you might like to see here. I welcome hearing your thoughts. If you have comments or suggestions and would like to send them to me, you can also do so by emailing me here: stories@magicalmishaps.com <em>(I will likely not answer most emails due to time, so don't expect it, but I will read them!)</em></p>",mm_n_aftermath.png,image_file,https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/27584390/3a14192627e34155b80e7d13a723192a/eyJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/1.png?token-time=1697068800&token-hash=IQNIJ5UjOuwYVGHINCSQFYeVpKJKGmfEaPChgcIHZiE%3D,https://www.patreon.com/posts/magical-mishaps-27584390,2019-06-12T20:31:07.000+00:00

15227270,Rose's Rescue,"An origin comic about the first meeting between Saria, Trace's future wife, and Rose, the cousin of Euchre. After being interrogated by then Grand Templar Mary Silverlock, Rose was kept a prisoner, and would have spent the rest of her life forgotten in a Templar dungeon.<p>Thankfully, Saria and a couple people inside the Templar arranged for her escape. Saria took Rose in, employing her as a servant (with pay!) until she could arrange travel back to wolf lands. Rose however, extremely grateful towards Saria, eventually decided she had nothing to go back to, and chose to stay.</p><p>Saria and Rose remained extremely close. Saria years later would marry Trace, ironically resulting in Rose once again ending up in Grand Templar hands after Trace took power.</p><p>This backstory comic was sketches many years ago, and finally brought to life by <strong>iliar </strong>with the creative use of a Nora Card!

7121016,Announcing Sunday Sketch Requests!,"Starting November, I'll be taking <strong>weekly suggestions </strong>for sketches! Anyone pledging $10 or more are welcome to add your ideas each week. Please note, I likely will not get to them all. I'll generally be looking for funny or creative suggestions, or just whatever sounds the most fun! Requests for pin-up style sketches or a little sauciness is of course perfectly fine as well. ;)  (No OCs, though. Sorry!)<p>The resulting sketches will be publicly available for <strong>everyone</strong>, patron or not, so everyone can enjoy them. Keep that in mind!</p><p>Starting next Sunday, and each subsequent Sunday, I will also begin doing <strong>Sunday Sketch Streams </strong>where I will be drawing the sketches you suggest here!</p><p>At the beginning of every month (starting December) I will hold a <strong>vote</strong>. All the sketches made in the previous month will be put up and the top picks will be made into finished full-color art, which will of course be publicly available as well.</p><p>I hope this sounds like fun for you guys! I wanted to give back to all of you who have been so generous. Up until now, you've pledged with no expectation of getting anything in return. I figured with this, those who contribute can now be rewarded. Those who can only contribute a little will still get to join in on the streams. And those that cannot contribute at all still get new sketches out of the deal! A win-win-win for everyone, I think. :)</p><p>Let me know what <em>you </em>think! Oh, and for this week, just to get started, anyone can feel free to make suggestions below for next week's stream, if you have any ideas!<br></p>",floratablet_banner.png,image_file,https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/post/7121016/06dfb0cd890f4493ac0943b7a2563536/eyJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/1.png?token-time=1697068800&token-hash=e9S93v-1B_tOKKFXtuyapRV9jKxibaPPN0lPjCpsyiw%3D,https://www.patreon.com/posts/announcing-7121016,2016-10-30T18:08:11.000+00:00

And truth be told I haven't been keeping up with the show. (sorry, younger me) I pretty much left it behind around Gen II.
