Mercurial is both destruction and renewal. He thrives in conflict, but does not desire total destruction, as that would end the fun. He sees himself as improving the world through pain and progress. Things need to be destroyed for new things to take their place.<br><br>Mercurial's mask is constantly shifting, taking many shapes and forms, never looking the same way twice.</p><p><strong>Ephemural</strong> (<em>whose name was once ""Ephemeral"" before Mercurial swapped out the 'e' as a prank, changing its spelling in all written text</em>) embodies the virtues of neutrality and balance. Disturbed by the humans spreading across what was supposed to be a pristine garden world, Ephemural was forced to act.</p><p>She created the <strong>Keidran</strong>, attempting to strike a balance with the existing natural world by modeling her creation after the animals that were already living on the planet. It was her hope that they would thrive in nature better than the humans and thus stop their spread.</p><p><strong>Eternal</strong>, the rigid and unchanging mask of order, was the last to abandon his post, seeing the chaos unfolding. He placed his creations, the <strong>Basitin</strong>, far away from the other races on their own island. The Basitins were designed to embody his virtues - stubborn, unchanging, and obsessed with the rule of law. He gave them a desire to follow orders and a strict social hierarchy, which they would follow instinctually.</p><p>The mask of Chaos found this all very fun and declared it a game, to which the others had no choice but to participate in. Humans spread across the map, conquering land, while Keidran did the same and the Basitins, naturally, continued turtling on their own territory. The masks have agreed not to interfere with the world directly in any substantial way and not use their powers on any race other than their own (rules they bend all the time, of course).<br><br>The Masks are constantly trying to find loopholes to one-up each other. For example, Neutral used Mary Silverlock's body as a host, which is something normally forbidden, since Mary is human. But Mary was transformed into a Keidran at the time by Trace, and thus fair game. The Masks use hosts to interact with the material world directly, as otherwise they are mostly restricted to their own realm and have little physical influence.<br><br>The three continue to be locked in their feud, the original vows to the old gods now long forgotten.<br><br><em>(Disclaimer: this image does not suggest that these characters have these masks in canon. For example, Adelaide is not in possession of the Mask of Order. She's just a visual representation of the Basitins as a whole, and the same goes for the others, in case there was any confusion.)</em></p>","Adelaide,Flora,Lore,Mask,Sunday Sketches,Trace"
